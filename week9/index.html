	<h2>Prototype</h2>
	<p>Prototypes are static implemenations of a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that are used to demonstrate design without fully implementing the backend of the site.  Prototypes are intended to be made quickly and easily changed to test basic aspects of the design and site with the client.  Prototypes can be based on simple wireframes or more complete mockups, or can be used as part of the design process itself.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Prototypes can use dummy content or client from the content.  They should represent all of the potential page templates of the site, the homepage, a static page, a blog post or user entry page, anything that will require a different template should be represented.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The main difference between a mockup and prototype is that a prototype uses interact web technology and therefore is able to represent interactions that cannot be shown with a mockup.  The client can see what it will feel like to open the site on their computer or smart phone, click on buttons, use links or scrolling interactions and experience the site in a way that mockups cannot provide.</p>

On Tuesday, groups should meet for 5-10 minutes at the beginning of the class to decide on the goals for that week.  Project Manager should record the goals

- Each goal for the week.
- Whether those goals were achieved.
- Any issues that came up with achieving goals.
- Any technical questions.
- Any questions or needs from the client.
- Other problems, group conflicts or notes that should be recorded.

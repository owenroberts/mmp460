<div class="slide">
	<p>Depending on group size you will have 4/5 roles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Project Manager</li>
		<li>User Experience / Interaction Designer</li>
		<li>Designer</li>

	</ul>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Everyone in each group is ultimately responsible for every aspect of the website.  If your role is Project Manager, you will focus on organizing the group, group reports and communications within the group and with the client, but you will be expected to contribute to design and development with ideas and work if needed.  Likewise, if your role is Developer, you will be expected to contribute to the discussion about communications and organization led by the Project Manager.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Individually, each person is responsible for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Understanding the tasks required of their role.</li>
		<li>Completing those tasks.</li>
		<li>Responding to communications in timely manner.</li>
		<li>Keeping track of group work.</li>
		<li>Communicate with group members.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Project Manager</h2>
	<p>The project manager is an organizer and communicator. Rather the PM helps the group make decisions, communicates issues to the professor and client and helps ensure good communication among group members. There will be more work at the beginning when everyone is getting to know each other and we’re just starting with communication and understanding the project.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Help make sure your group is communicating, with each other, with me and with 	the client</li>
		<li>Weekly Reports. You don’t have to write them by yourself, but help make sure 	they are done and turned in.</li>
		<li>Keep track of how your group is doing in terms of meeting deadlines. Communicate 	this, whether on track or off track, with the group and the professor</li>
		<li>Help others with production work.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>User Experience / Interaction Designer</h2>
	<p>This role is responsible for understanding all of the content for the site and how it is organized (pages, posts, menus). This includes thinking about the users of the site and ensure they can do what they want to do easily and as intuitively as possible.</p>
	<p>User experience involves taking the wireframes to the next level in terms of planning out what the user will see at each stage of their experience with the website.  You will also help the designers and developers with implementation.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Designer</h2>
	<p>The designer is responsible for understanding every aspect of the design that the client wants and implementing them visually. Some examples of the kinds of things you’ll do:</p>

		<li>Typography: choosing fonts, creating a Typographic Hierarchy</li>
		<li>Style guide</li>
		<li>Images</li>

<div class="slide">
	<p><strong>Front-end Developer</strong></p>

	<p>Your main tasks involve getting the WordPress theme to work. You will work closely with the front-end developer to get the design and functionality implemented</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure the right Templates and Template Parts are created</li>
		<li>functionality like: Menus, Featured Images, Enqueueing scripts/styles, widgets, custom fields</li>
		<li>Choosing and implementing plugins if required</li>

# First Group Meeting
[Home]({{site.github.url}}/) > [Week 8]({{site.github.url}}/schedule.html#week-8)

- Introduce yourselves and talk about general approach to design/development
- Make a group Slack channel and invite @owen
- Brainstorm 10 questions for the client as a group, submit on Slack
	- Think about what the client might need in a website, and what your strengths as a group might be.  Write down these ideas and questions that come out of them, for example, “What is the most important information that will be displayed on the page?” or “How many users will need access to make updates?”  The Project Manager should take notes.
	- You should prepare more questions than you plan to ask.  The presenter will answer some of your questions during the presentation.  Be prepared to adapt your questions to the information learned during presentation.
- Developers: create a GitHub repo for theme files and share with all group members
- Designers: discuss how to share files, consider Google Drive, Dropbox or another cloud host
